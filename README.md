```

### <a id="issues">Known Issues</a>
* Ember specific packages:

  When installing an ember specific package <ex: `ember-cli-bourbon`> that would change of overwrite some of the projects files, inspect the diff by choosing `d`(figure 1) and then choose to make the changes yourself or let cli overwrite the files (figure 2).

  ```js
  this.resource('posts', {path: 'posts'}, () => {
    this.route('new');
  });
  ```
  Valid:
  ```js
  this.route('posts', { resetNamespace: true }, function() {
